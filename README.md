# Slack Identity Mobile App

## Project Description

Welcome to the Slack Identity Mobile App, a project developed during my internship journey. This mobile application is designed to highlight my Slack identity and seamlessly integrate my GitHub profile for easy access.

### Features

1. **Slack Name Display:** The app prominently features my Slack name on the main screen, ensuring easy identification.

2. **Display Picture:** My high-quality Slack profile picture is seamlessly integrated into the main screen, adding a personal touch.

3. **Open GitHub Button:** The standout feature of this app is the "Open GitHub" button. Tapping it redirects users to my GitHub profile using a WebView component, establishing a direct link between the app and my GitHub presence.

### Achievements

- Created an intuitive and user-friendly UI with clear labeling and navigation.
- Ensured full responsiveness, providing a seamless experience on various device sizes.
- Successfully implemented the "Open GitHub" button functionality for convenient GitHub profile access.

## Project Repository

Find the source code and project files in the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/KellyDanielO/hngx_task_one).

## Demonstration

Experience the app in action through a virtualized demo version on [Appetize.io](https://appetize.io/app/im2owk2cmzifherwgx3wdvaerq?device=pixel4&osVersion=11.0&scale=75).

I'm proud of the outcome of this project, which not only meets the internship task but also demonstrates my commitment to user-centric and functional mobile app development. I look forward to continuing my journey in mobile development and exploring exciting projects in the future. Thank you for your interest and support!
